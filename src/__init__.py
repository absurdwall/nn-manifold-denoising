Neural Network Manifold Denoising - Source Code

A clean implementation of neural network-based manifold denoising research.

Pipeline Overview:
1. data_generation: Generate synthetic manifold datasets
2. dataset_estimation: Estimate geometric properties  
3. plotting: Visualize data and results
4. network_training: Train denoising networks
5. analysis: Analyze and summarize results

Each module is organized in its respective subdirectory with clear separation of concerns.
