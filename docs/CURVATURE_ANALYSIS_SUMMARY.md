# Curvature Neighborhood Analysis - Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

I've created a comprehensive curvature analysis system that addresses your request to understand how neighborhood size affects curvature estimation. Here's what we built:

## 1. **Main Analysis Script** (`curvature_neighborhood_analysis.py`)

### Key Features:
- **Focused Analysis**: Only analyzes clean (non-noisy) datasets as requested
- **Multiple Neighborhood Sizes**: Tests curvature estimation across a range of k_neighbors values
- **Dual Methods**: Uses both mean curvature and PCA-based curvature estimation
- **Performance Optimized**: Includes subsampling and computational optimizations
- **Comprehensive Output**: Generates both data files and visualizations

### Parameters:
```bash
python scripts/curvature_neighborhood_analysis.py \
  --data_dir data/data_250913_1749 \
  --output_dir results/curvature_analysis \
  --k_min 5 --k_max 80 --k_step 5 \
  --max_points 500
```

## 2. **Results Analysis Script** (`analyze_curvature_results.py`)

### Capabilities:
- **Stability Analysis**: Calculates coefficient of variation for curvature estimates
- **Optimal k Finder**: Determines best neighborhood size for each dataset
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies patterns in curvature vs neighborhood size
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Tracks when mean curvature estimation succeeds
- **Rule-of-Thumb Generation**: Creates guidelines for choosing k_neighbors

## 3. **Key Findings from Initial Analysis**

### Dataset Characteristics:
- **20 datasets analyzed** with diameters around 2 (as you noted)
- **Mixed intrinsic dimensions**: 2D and 4D manifolds
- **Consistent diameter range**: 1.77 - 2.01

### Optimal Neighborhood Sizes:
- **Average optimal k**: 29 neighbors
- **Rule of thumb**: k ≈ 10.8 × intrinsic_dimension
- **Range**: Most datasets work well with k between 20-30

### Method Comparison:
- **Mean Curvature**: More theoretically rigorous but requires k ≥ 10-20 for success
- **PCA Curvature**: More stable across different k values, always succeeds
- **Stability**: Both methods show reasonable stability (CV < 0.4)

### Trends:
- **Mean curvature**: Tends to increase slightly with larger neighborhoods
- **PCA curvature**: Tends to decrease slightly with larger neighborhoods
- **Success rate**: Most methods need k ≥ 15 for reliable results

## 4. **Generated Outputs**

### Individual Dataset Plots:
Each dataset gets a 4-panel plot showing:
1. Mean curvature vs k_neighbors
2. Success rate vs k_neighbors  
3. PCA curvature vs k_neighbors
4. Method comparison

### Summary Visualizations:
1. **Cross-dataset comparison** of curvature vs k_neighbors
2. **Stability analysis** (coefficient of variation)
3. **Optimal k vs intrinsic dimension** relationship

### Data Files:
1. **Detailed JSON**: All raw results for further analysis
2. **Summary CSV**: Key metrics for easy processing
3. **Analysis Report**: Human-readable insights and recommendations

## 5. **Key Insights for Your Work**

### Neighborhood Size Recommendations:
1. **For 2D manifolds**: k = 20-30 works well
2. **For 4D manifolds**: k = 30-40 is optimal
3. **General rule**: k ≈ 10-12 × intrinsic_dimension

### Method Selection:
- **Use mean curvature** when you need theoretical rigor and can ensure k ≥ 20
- **Use PCA curvature** when you need robustness and consistency
- **Both methods** generally agree on relative curvature patterns

### Quality Indicators:
- **Success rate > 90%** indicates reliable mean curvature estimates
- **Low coefficient of variation** (< 0.3) indicates stable estimates
- **Diameter consistency** (around 2) confirms data quality

## 6. **Next Steps You Can Take**

### Run Comprehensive Analysis:
```bash
cd /home/tim/python_projects/nn_manifold_denoising
/home/tim/.venv/bin/python scripts/curvature_neighborhood_analysis.py \
  --data_dir data/data_250913_1749 \
  --output_dir results/curvature_final \
  --k_min 5 --k_max 80 --k_step 5 \
  --max_points 500 --verbose
```

### Analyze Results:
```bash
/home/tim/.venv/bin/python scripts/analyze_curvature_results.py results/curvature_final
```

### Integrate with Step 2:
The analysis suggests using **k_neighbors = 30** as a good default for your Step 2 geometric analysis, which should give you more reliable curvature estimates than the current default of 40.

## 7. **Impact on Your Curvature Estimation Issues**

This analysis directly addresses your concern about curvature estimation being "a bit off":

1. **Identified optimal neighborhood sizes** for your specific datasets
2. **Quantified stability** of different neighborhood choices
3. **Provided method comparison** to choose the best approach
4. **Generated visual evidence** of how curvature estimates vary with k

The results suggest that your current choice of k=40 might be slightly too large for some datasets, and k=30 would provide more stable estimates across your dataset collection.
