# Neural Network Manifold Denoising

A clean implementation of neural network-based manifold denoising research.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code organized by functionality
- `data/` - Generated datasets and their geometric properties
- `results/` - Neural network training results
- `figs/` - Figures and visualizations
- `logs/` - Execution logs for background processes
- `examples/` - Usage examples and tutorials

## Pipeline

1. **Dataset Generation** - Generate synthetic manifold data
2. **Dataset Estimation** - Compute geometric properties and estimations
3. **Plotting** - Visualize datasets and properties
4. **Network Training** - Train neural networks for denoising
5. **Analysis** - Analyze training results and performance
